# Why do I use this config?

Most of these plugins are fairly light, responsive, and configurable. Moreover, they offer plenty of functionality for what I do (some web-app stuff, smaller C++ projects, etc.). Should I need or want to move to larger codebases, more complicated projects, I'll look towards other robust plugins.
