# WHAT IS THIS?

# Personal neovim config files
- I use [junegunn's vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as my plugin manager!
- Plugins include:
    - [lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)
        - I particularly enjoy writing in C++, Python, and JavaScript. I'm learning Rust, at the moment, too. \#BlazinglyFast or whatever people say.
    - [cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp)
    - [autopairs](https://github.com/windwp/nvim-autopairs)
    - [treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)
    - [NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree)
    - [lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim)
    - [luasnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip)
    - [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
    - [plenary](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim)
    - [popup](https://github.com/nvim-lua/popup.nvim)
    - [web-devicons](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons)
    - [lspsaga](https://github.com/glepnir/lspsaga.nvim)
    - [nvim-jdtls](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls)
- I alternative between [nightfox](https://github.com/EdenEast/nightfox.nvim) and [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) depending on the OS (MacOS' stock terminal doesn't support more than a 256 color palette, so :shrugs:).

# Why do I use this config?
---
Most of these plugins are fairly light, responsive, and configurable. Moreover, they offer plenty of functionality for what I do (some web-app stuff, smaller C++ projects, etc.). Should I need or want to move to larger codebases, more complicated projects, I'll look towards other robust plugins.
